## rinsmiles' Guide to the Void

https://grebord.github.io/rinsmiles-guide-to-the-void/

rinsmiles´ Guide to the Void is a guide for installing and setting up a Void operating system:

https://voidlinux.org

It mainly, and merely intends to guide the user through the steps, providing hints and examples along the way, and it is complemented by the official Void documentation.

The installation is performed from the ground up, by bootstrapping the new system with the XBPS package manager from a console. After following through with this guide, the user will have a fully configured, reliable, performant and fundamental system which they can then tune and extend to their requirements.

This guide assumes that the user is familiar with the use of a shell, core utilities and GNU/Linux operating systems, and that they will take a look at specific documentation of any tool and feature with which they are not.
